# Etch-a-Sketch

Taking DOM Manipulation a step further by adding in loops and event listeners. Takes a default base number of 4 and makes a 4x4 grid of square containers that a user can "paint" by moving their mouse through them. The user can click reset to change the base number used for the size of the grid, which also clears the board of any "paint".
